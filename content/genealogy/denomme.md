The etymology of Denomme is believed to have originated with the french word L'Homme (the man.) The name was brought to North America as Delaunay in the early 1600s, changed to DeLomey in 1694 and then Denomme in 1728.

[Ambroise Denommé](/tree/ps01/ps01_123.html) (1801-1861) and [Marguerite Robillard](/tree/ps02/ps02_019.html) (1799-1858), who had 14 children together, moved with some of their family from Joliette, Quebec to Huron County, Ontario in the mid-19th century. One of their sons, [Louis Désiré Denomme](/tree/ps01/ps01_144.html) (1832-1916) married [Louise Sarah Ducharme](/tree/ps01/ps01_178.html) (1837-1885) and they had 13 children together.
