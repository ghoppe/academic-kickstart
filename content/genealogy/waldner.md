The Waldner family originated from Stockenboi, Austria, where Peter Wallder/Walder resided in the 1490s. Waldner (Waltner) is a common family name among the the [Hutterian Brethren](https://feefhs.org/erg/hutterites-brief-history) of South Dakota and the Swiss Mennonites of Kansas. Both share common descent from [Georg Waldner](/tree/wc03/wc03_340.html), a farmer of the Ertlguet homestead in the Amlach district of Carinthia, Austria, who was exiled in 1755 along with his wife and three children to Siebenbuergen, Transylvania.
