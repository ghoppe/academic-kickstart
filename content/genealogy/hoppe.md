My aunt Elisabeth Hoppe compiled a small duotang of family genealogy tracing the Hoppe family in Saskatchewan back to Christoph Hoppe. Using this starting point, I was discovered the [website of William Remus](https://williamremus.com/genes/home.htm), which confirmed many details about the descendents of Christoph Hoppe. His website is a treasure-trove of information on germans in Volhynia. There you can also find the [story written by Rose Clausen-Mohr](https://williamremus.com/genes/Volhynia/Remusstory.htm) about her mother, Maria Deutschander (Christoph's wife's niece.) It's a marvellous recounting of what life was like in the village of Berestowitz, where my grandfather was born.

At least four families related to Christoph Hoppe emigrated to Canada in the early 1900s. The first to arrive was August Hoppe, his wife Marie and her daughter Christine. They arrived in Montreal on board the S/S Lake Superior on 13 Jun 1900.

August's brother, Johann Hoppe, his wife Wilhelmina and their sons, Ferdinand, August and Andreas were next arrive on 10 May 1902 at the port of Montreal, on board the S/S Montfort.

A third brother, Johan Wilhelm Hoppe, arrived with his wife Justine Domres and seven children on 26 May 1911 on the R.M.S. Ausonia. Johann's step-daughter, Louise Brenner, her husband Frederick, and four of their children arrived a year later on 17 Apr 1912 at the port of St. John, New Brunswick, Canada, on board the S/S Pisa.
