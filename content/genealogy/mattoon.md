Probably of French Huguenot origin, the Mattoons probably bore the continental name of Maton. Thousands of French Huguenots took refuge in Holland and England in the wake of religious persecutions in France during the 15th century. The first colonial ancestor of Mattoons in North America was Hujbrecht Mattoon. He signed the Oath of Allegiance to the government of the Massachusetts Bay Colony on 16 Nov 1652.

[A genealogy](https://lccn.loc.gov/67123920) of the descendents of Philip Mattoon of Deerfield Massachusetts, son of Hujbrecht, was published in 1965. I owe much of my research into the Mattoon family to this book.
