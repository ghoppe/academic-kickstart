<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Robert Richard Abell</div>

<div class="psNotesData">Was the immigrant who came to New England with John Winthrop on the Winthrop Fleet, in June 1630 and settled at Rehobeth, MA. He took the Oath of Freeman May 18, 1631.<br /><br />Possible connection here to nobility<br />Born about 1605 and died 20 June 1661. He was the immigrant who came to New England with John Winthrop, in June 1630 and settled at Rehobeth, Mass. He married Joanna whose last name is not known.<br /><br />Robert was first mentioned in his father's will 1630 as then living in New England.  He came to America probably in the fleet with Gov. Winthrop, which arrived at Charlestown, Mass., June 1630 (Savage).<br /><br />The first record of Robert in America is at Weymouth, Mass., included in a list as desirous to be made a Freeman, October 19, 1630 and he took the Oath of Freeman May 18, 1631.  He is mentioned at the Quarterly Court, held at Boston December 4, 1638 and June 2, 1640 at Weymouth.  He is mentioned in regards to land owned by John Ffussell, John Stable and James Snooke, October 26, 1642 to May 21, 1644.<br /><br />Robert removed from Weymouth in 1643, probably following Rev. Samuel Newman, the real founder of Rehoboth.  Rev. Newman was minister at Weymouth for four and a half or five years, then with a majority of his congregation, in 1642 removed to a place called by the Indians Seekonk, to which he gave the name of Rehoboth.<br /><br />The first meeting of the original planters of Rehoboth, to be found on record, is dated at &quot;Weimoth&quot; the 24th of the 8th month (October) 1643; the next meeting of the proprietors was held at Weymouth, the 10th day of the 10th month (December) 1643.  About the year 1643 a joint agreement was made by the inhabitants of Sea-conk alias Rehoboth, for the bringing in of their estates; that so men's allotments might be taken up according to person and estate, also for carrying on of all public charges both for present and future; furthermore the means and interest of what is here expressed is that by which lands now granted by the Court of Plymouth to the town are to be divided according to person and estate, as is expressed in a list of 58 names.  The 28th name on the list is Job Lane (underneath written), &quot;now Robert Abell's&quot; F50; it is evident that Robert Abell was written in after he had bought of Job Lane.<br /><br />At a meeting of the town February 18, 1646 it was agreed to draw lots for the new meadow, and to be divided according to person and estate, only those that were under F150, estate to be made up 150.  Robert is the 41st name on a list of 46 who drew for lots.<br /><br />The 26th of the 12th month, 1651 it was agreed that Robert Abell and Richard Bullock should burn the commons round about, from the Indian fence, all on the neck, to the new meadow near, and so far about the fresh meadows as may be convenient; and they are to have 20s, for their pains, and to begin the 15th of March next, and to be paid out of the first rate.<br /><br />The 28th of March, 1653 it was concluded and agreed upon, that Robert Abell should have three acres of meadow on the north side of the line, next to the town, next the line that parteth the land of the purchasers and the town of Rehoboth.  This meadow was given them by Mr. Prince, Captain Standish and Mr. Winslow.<br /><br />Mention is made of Robert in Court Orders, June 29, 1653, June 10, 1661 and April 22, 1662.<br /><br />On February 1, 1654 at a town meeting, Robert was ordered to keep the Ordinary, and on July 3, 1656, Plymouth, Mass., he is allowed by the Court to keep an Ordinary at Rehoboth.  (An Ordinary is a place where meals are provided.)<br /><br />Robert was at the Court of Elections at Plymouth, June 3, 1657 and on Jury at the General Court at Plymouth, June 4, 1657 and took the oath of fidelity in 1657.<br /><br /><br />Sources:<br /><br />1.
