<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Caleb Abell</div>

<div class="psNotesData">Sgt. Caleb Abell is first mentioned in the Colonial records at Dedham in 1665, petitioned for Freeman in Dedham, May 3, 1665;  in 1668 moved to Norwich, Conn.  In the original purchase of land when Norwich was settled, six acres having 16 rods front was assigned to Robert Wade, this he sold to Caleb Abell in 1677, and it was afterwards known as the Abell homestead.  This property abutted on Town Street 16 rods, on the home lot of Morgan Bowers 72 rods, on the river 18 rods and on John Birchard land 74 rods.  The location may be seen in a map on page 67 of &quot;Caulkins' Norwich.&quot;  On December 18, 1694 Caleb was appointed to keep his house as &quot;an ordinari or of entertayment&quot; for the year, or until another be chosen.<br /><br />In 1697 Caleb and ten others were allowed to build a seat on the east side of the meeting house on the Leanto beams for their convenient sitting on the Lord's Days.   Rev. Huntington's book of  &quot;Old Houses of the Ancient Town of Norwich&quot; names 36 men whom he supposes to have been original proprietors; but one of these was Richard Wallis and another was Caleb Abell, who in 1660 was only 14 years of age.  On May 2, 1728 Caleb deeded 12 1/4 acres of land to his daughter, Experience Hide.  On January 12, 1727-8 Caleb deeded to his son Noah his home lot, dwelling house and barn, all lands adjoining his home lot and lands over the river (Yantic) his pasture land lying northerly and northeasterly of William Hide dwelling house (which house was on the other side of Town Street and a little to the east) lying in two parcels, together with land on both sides of Bradford brook on north side of road leading to Lebanon, except 1 1/2 acres on south east of brook and land near Benjamin Abell's dwelling house which he gave to his son Samuel, reserving to himself and his wife Marey the dwelling house during his life and for hers after his decease, also liberty to his daughter Hannah to dwell in said house so long as she remains unmarried and a passageway across home lot to his son Samuel to Samuel's own land.<br /><br />Caleb joined the first church of Norwich before 1701.  He was Sergeant of the Norwich Train Band in 1701 and Selectman in 1682, Constable in 1684 and 1706 and Townsman in 1689.  In the books of Grants in Norwich, there are 38 or more items to Caleb Abell.<br /><br /><br />Sources:<br /><br />1.   The Abell Family In America (1940)<br />2.
