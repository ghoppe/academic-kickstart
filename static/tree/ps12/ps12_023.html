<div class="psNotesData">&quot;The House of Jacob, The Story of Jacob Janzen(1822-1885)&quot;, &quot;Jacobs Ruhe&quot; Freemen, SD and His Descendants.  Copyright 1984, by Frances Janzen Voth. Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 83-091510. <br /><br />He was probably the son of school teacher Daniel Janzen, who taught in the Hutterite villages and even officiated at some Hutterite marriages, according to the old record book. Jakob Janzen and his family died outside the colony, with son Peter being the only one who remained in colony life. He immigrated from Hutterthal, S. Russia, per the Hamburg departure lists. (see <a href="http://awt.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=bobstrong&amp;id=I118477">http://awt.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=bobstrong&amp;id=I118477</a>)<br /><br />Title: Brothers in deed to brothers in need<br />Author: Hiebert, Clarence<br />Publication: Faith &amp; Life Press, 1974.<br />Text: Brothers in Deed to Brothers in Need<br />Page: 297</div>

<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Jacob Janzen</div>

<div class="psNotesData">Our information about Great Grandfather Jacob is still very meager. He was born in the Ukraine, Russia in 1822. By 1845 he had two sons, Daniel and Jacob. In 1947 a printed copy of &quot;Das Kleine Geschichtsbuch der Hutterischen Brüder&quot;, edited by A.J.F. Zieglschmid of Northwestern University was published. On page 437 we read as follows: &quot;A school was opened in Huttertal on November 20, 1845 with 91 schoolchildren.&quot; Johann Cornies remarks on how fortunate the village was to obtain the services of Jacob Janzen. Cornies, a Mennonite, had leased a large parcel of land from the government for grazing his sheep. He became very wealthy and the Russian government recognized his outstanding ability and made him the diplomatic agent of all the Mennonites in Russia. When the Hutterites came, he also helped them to found the new colony of Hutterthal. This was not a Brüderhof but practiced private ownership like a typical Mennonite village. They became successful farmers in the Mennonite pattern. After Cornies death they founded a second colony, Johannesruh and latera third, Sheromet. A footnote also states that Jacob Janzen is the father of Peter Janzen. Jacob was presumably married the first time in 1841 at age 19. He was widowed by 1848.<br />J.J. Mendel in his book &#8220;History of the People of Freeman and Silver Lake,&#8221; has a list of the householders of Hutterthal, Ukraine at the time they migrated to S.Dakota. One of them is Jacob Janzen at House #16. The ship list of the S.S. Gellert arriving in New York on July 29, 1876, lists Jacob Janzen, age 54, and wife Maria with 8 children among the passengers. He settled first at Bon Homme Colony in S. Dakota, but shortly claimed a homestead four miles north and five miles west of Freeman, S. Dakota where he died July 29, 1885. We believe he may have had a total of 12 children, Daniel and Jacob by his first wife and ten by his second wife Maria (Waldner) Janzen. The youngest, Marie 1 month old appears in the ship list in 1876, but no further record of her has been found. The 1880 U.S. Census does not list her but shows Jacob living on his homestead with his wife, Maria, and six children: William, Anna, Elizabeth, John, Cornelius and David. The last report of Jacob Janzen in the Rundschau appeared September 17, 1884 and dated August 30, 1884. In it he describes in dramatic style the appearance of a tornado and its tragic destruction on the farm of Elias Wipf, a distance of ten miles north of Jacob&#8217;s homestead.<br />From &quot;The House of Jacob - The Story of Jacob Janzen (1822-1885)&quot; by Frances Janzen Voth, Copyright©1984, Pg. 13</div>

<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Jacob Janzen</div>

<div class="psNotesData">Dear &quot;Rundschau&quot;<br />It's been a long time since I wrote, so now I will endeavor to make up for my neglect in letting you know of the terrible misgortune that happened in our settlement. I want to share this experience with the readers of &quot;Rundschau.&quot; On the 28th A.M. the sun shone real hot, the wind, from the South was oppressive and sultry so that it was hard to breathe and people, like the animals, could hardly work. At 2:30 a black, ominous storm cloud came from the North which made the oppressive heat go even higher for a terrible storm to take place.<br />Toward 3:30 a whirl wind started to form in the West, first small, but in a few seconds with great force it turned toward the North where it connected with that rolling storm cloud, where it suddenly turned itself into a double funnel.<br />Suddnely a bolt of lightning with a terrible crash of thunder, which seemed to shake the earth, came down. It was as though this was the signal for the devastation to start, for immediately the tornado struck the earth and moved from the North to the Southeast. Anything that was in it's path was carried away. From my farm I could see everything for about 10 or 12 miles and with fear and trembling see it come toward us. It is impossible to describe how terrible it was, as in the twinkling of an eye the clouds and earth transformed itself as it rolled about. I haven't figured out yet how wide and long the tail of the tornado was, because I'm busy threshing. It didn't reach far and wide, but wherever it struck it left a lot of misery and damage.<br />It did the worst damage on the Elias Wipf farm, who lived in Wolf Creek, and was busy cutting hay. His father, a man of 74 years, his son Elias, wife and a son, 7 years old, loaded up the hay when the tornado struck. Young Wipf motioned for them to follow him and hurried to the house, but it was impossible for him to help them, since everything was crashing, quivering and breaking. Doors and windows were pressed inward and everything in the yard was carried away. Wipf quickly grabbed his half dead mother and took her to the cellar, also his three children and he stayed in the cellar till the crashing, roaring and noise eased up a little he went out but what a sight he saw. The big wooden barn which adjoined the house was gone except a part of the side wall lay there. The kitchen which was built on to the house, the shingles and most of the boards were all gone. The hay had disappeared. The pig barn and the feeder pigs were nowhere to be seen. The horses, machines, besides the binder were gone, the sheepbarn had no roof, just the bare walls. In one word everything was destroyed<br />Where were father, mother and son, oxen and wagons? Finally everything was found but in what condition: naked, disfigured corpses. One ox had its head torn off and the other one was also killed. The wagon was broken in pieces, not a spoke in the hub, the rim of the wheel was also in pieces.<br />The young woman (she was Wipf's second wife) was married to Wipf for one and a half years. Her name was Maria Hofer. She and the boy took refuge behind a wheat stack, but with all the rest of the grain you couldn't see where the stacks had stood. The terrible disfigured corpses were buried the following day in the cool lap of the earth. May their ashes rest in peace.<br />After the tornado did it's damage on the Elias Wipf place it suddenly lifted itself and moved quick as lightning in a Southeasterly direction toward Freeman where it again came down to the ground. Like a snake, it was terrible to see how it flew here and there and blew all the flax around as it lay in the field. But the storm wasn't as bad as it was at Wolf Creek and no lives were lost. It only lasted a few minutes at Freeman and then it vanished as quickly as it came.<br />One farmer, Andrew Dekker, tried to hurry home when he saw the storm coming, but the storm caught him and lifted him up high, but he came down unharmed. The roof was torn off his house and his threshed grain swept away. Wipf's neighbor, Jacob Tschetter, lost both his barns in the storm. Wipf lost four splendid horses and two pair of oxen and all his horned cattle. Only his sheep which were grazing in the distance and three colts were saved. Poor man.<br />Those concerned will no doubt have a hard time to get over the terrible shock of these deaths. May the Lord our God have mercy on all of them.<br />Jacob Janzen<br />From &quot;The House of Jacob - The Story of Jacob Janzen (1822-1885)&quot; by Frances Janzen Voth, Copyright©1984, Pg. 16</div>
